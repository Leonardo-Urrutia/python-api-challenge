From analyzing a handful of variables from 560 different randomly, yet uniformly generated coordinates, there are several trends that are worth noting.

There is a direct correlation with Latitude and Temperature. The closer to 0 degrees latitude (the equator), the hotter the average temperature gets. From the weather data pulled on October 30, 2020, the averate temperature is around 80 degrees. When visualizing the temperature and latitude on a scatter plot, a parabolic figure is represented with the apex being around 0 degrees latitude. (See fig 1 in output_data directory.)

 There is a noticeable amount of locations in the nothern hemisphere that is above 80% humidity. The further north we analyze; the points on the plot gets more concentrated. When the data points are split between hemispheres, the concentrated grouping is noticable. When all of the data points are arregated from both hemispheres, the concentration stands out to a greater extent. (See fig 2 & fig 7) The southern hemiphere is currently in the middle of Spring and the humidity levels are a lot scatted and less correlation in comparison to the Northern hemisphere being in Autumn. (See fig 8)

 The average wind speeds around 10 regardless of the relation to the equator, but there are a lot less anamolous wind speeds when looking directly at the equator. The further from the equator in both directors displays more locations that have wind speeds above 20 mph. (See fig 4)
